# Intentional Typography & Variable Font Demos
Typographic system demonstration pages, in particular showcasing the use of variable fonts from a range of different designers.

These pages are intended to showcase both typographic techniques applied to the web and the emerging Variable Font format. The typefaces featured are courtesy of their respective designers as noted. It would be remiss of me to not call out CJ Dunn (http://cjtype.com) and David Jonathan Ross (https://djr.com) in particular for their enthusiasm and generosity in beginning these demonstrations.
